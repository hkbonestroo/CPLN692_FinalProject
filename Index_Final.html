Based on its lack of close access to a grocery store, the pilot would be located in Northerm Garfield. Should the pilot prove successful, it could be scaled up within the study area and to other neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.
                        This proposal is also relatively low-cost and could be deployed quickly in approximately one to three years. Most expenses would be administrative, but other costs incurred may result from subsidizing vendors, and creating a new system of licensing and enforcement.
